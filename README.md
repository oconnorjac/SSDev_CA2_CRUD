## About this project...
This repository hosts a working secure **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update and Delete) application using **PHP** and connected to a **MySQL** database using a **PDO** connection. 
This is a public repository, so please download the code, hack it to pieces and make your own application. If you find any bugs or have ways to improve the code, please email me on: _D00233669@dkit.ie._
This project is a dynamic data-driven web application using **server-side scripting** and **relational databases** along with both client-side and server-side **validation** and **data cleansing** techniques. Deployed, configured and tested on a remote server using **FTP/SFTP**.
